# EasyNote Audio
## Mission Statement
Our mission is to develop an app that makes notetaking convenient and simple. We want to create an app that is accessible to people therefore we have features such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech so the user can take and listen to notes mostly hand-free. We also value organization, so users can create and name multiple notes all in one place.
## Description 
Our app is designed to be of help for a diverse group of people with different needs. EasyNote Audio’s main purpose is to make note taking easy and accessible for everyone. Features such as speech to text and text to speech can enhance the users experience by allowing hands off note taking abilities. This feature can be especially handy if users have a disability or simply do not have free hands to take notes. Users can also add bullet points to their notes as well as create their own to-do list. These features will further enhance the user experience by giving them access to different forms of note taking. Whether that’s a to-do list or several bullet points.
